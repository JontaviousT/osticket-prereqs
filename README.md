## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop 
- Internet Information Services (IIS)
- 
## Operating Systems Used

- Windows 10 (21H2)
</b>

## List of Prerequisites

1. Create a virtual machine in Azure and access it using Remote Desktop
2. Access the required installation files
3. Enable IIS and subsequent features in Windows VM
4. Download and install the required installation files
5. Setup osTicket
6. Access your osTicket helpdesk admin login and end-user page
7. Clean up your setup and permissions

## Installation Steps

### Create a Virtual Machine in Azure and Access it Using Remote Desktop
> **Note:**
> Using a virtual machine to host osTicket preserves resources on your personal machine. It also keeps it safe.

<p>
Name your VM "VM-osTicket" for best organizational practices. The region you choose is where your VM's physical reasources are located. Create a VM with a Windows 10 image and 4vCPUs for optimal proccessing speed. Set a usermae and password you will remember, this is how you will log onto the desktop. Creating a new VM in azure will automatically create a vnet (your VM's network) and a resource group (where your VM will be stored in Azure). Ensure RDP port 3389 is enabled, this is how you will access your VM's desktop. Make no changes on the Disk tab. On the Network tab observe your vnet and IP address. Ensure that the IP and NIC will delete when your VM is deleted. This prevents unwanted storage charges in Azure. Make no changes on the Management, Monitoring, and Advanced tabs. Review and create your VM. Wait for Deployment to finish.

<p>
Copy VM-osTicket's public IP address and paste it in Remote Desktop Connection (Windows) or Microsoft Remote Desktop (MacOS). Give it a "friendly name" and log in with the username and password you configured. If using a Windows PC, your log in screen may look different. The functions are still the same. The VM's desktop will populate after a successful login.

### Download and the Install the Required Installation Files
>**Note:**
>This is the longest step, so each part is broken down for your convenience.

>**Warning:**
>Some of these installation files are out of date, however they are still functional (and free). Because of this, you may come across a stop message; "This file type might be dangerous". Download the files anyway. The isolated VM hosted in Microsoft Azure keeps your personal machine safe.
